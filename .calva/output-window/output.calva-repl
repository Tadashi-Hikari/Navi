; This is the Calva evaluation results output window.
; TIPS: The keyboard shortcut `ctrl+alt+o o` shows and focuses this window
;   when connected to a REPL session.
; Please see https://calva.io/output/ for more info.
; Happy coding! ♥️

; Jacking in...
; Connecting using "Leiningen" project type.
; You can make Calva auto-select this.

; 
; Starting Jack-in Terminal: pushd c:\Users\ccarroll\Documents\GitHub\Navi & cmd.exe /d /c lein update-in :dependencies conj [nrepl,"1.0.0"] -- update-in :plugins conj [cider/cider-nrepl,"0.28.5"] -- update-in [:repl-options,:nrepl-middleware] conj '["cider.nrepl/cider-middleware"]' -- repl :headless & popd
; Using host:port 127.0.0.1:63625 ...
; Hooking up nREPL sessions ...
; Connected session: clj
; TIPS:
;   - You can edit the contents here. Use it as a REPL if you like.
;   - `alt+enter` evaluates the current top level form.
;   - `ctrl+enter` evaluates the current form.
;   - `alt+up` and `alt+down` traverse up and down the REPL command history
;      when the cursor is after the last contents at the prompt
;   - Clojure lines in stack traces are peekable and clickable.

 The purpose of DevOps is to improve collaboration and streamline processes between development and operations teams in order to deliver software faster and more reliably. DevSecOps expands on this by integrating security practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle to ensure that applications are secure and compliant from the start.
